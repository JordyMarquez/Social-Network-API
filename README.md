# Social-Network-API
NoSQL Challenge

## Description
This app uses NoSql to create, update, and delete users, their thoughts, friends and reactions. The app uses an MVC schema structure and requires Insomnia to test routes and MongoDB to check the database. 

## Usage: 
In order to use this app, the client must run `npm i` to install a package.json, `npm i express` to install express, and `npm i mongoose`, to be able to store data in MongoDB. Once installed, the client uses Insomnia to seed their data using GET, PUT, DELETE, and POST routes.
